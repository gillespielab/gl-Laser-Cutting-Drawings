# Laser Cutter Drawings
Only use the "- pathed" versions of files when laser cutting; raw files are preserved in case they need to be re-pathed (i.e. if the formatting needs to be different because you're not using one of the ULS laser cutters at The Mill). To create pathed files from raw files, use the laser cutting prep tool: https://github.com/gillespielab/gl-laser-cutting-prep-tool
